<h4 style="margin-bottom: 10px;font-weight: 400;">As part of the intro to HCI course by Prof. Michel Beaudouin-Lafon, We implemented the interaction technique -- \Colorhref{https://engineering.purdue.edu/~elm/projects/polyzoom/polyzoom.pdf}{PolyZoom} from CHI 2012 by building a mash-up application which uses the technique. The application allows user to navigate tweets around the world by progressively building hierarchies of focus regions (stacked on top) with certain magnification. The hierarchies can be created and compared side by side which provides spatial context for tweets and therefore helps in comparing tweets from spatially distant parts of the world simultaneously. The applications is built on nodeJS, by using APIs such as Twitter search API and Google maps API.</h4>
