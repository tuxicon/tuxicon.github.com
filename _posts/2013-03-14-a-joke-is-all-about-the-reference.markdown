[Not a Taco Bell Material](http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1333128127l/13568887.jpg) 

The books sure not for everybody, but people who like his style of humor are usually people who love to see the funny side of things, even when shit gets bad. Adam corolla is an amazing writer. I have never heard his podcast but he sure does know , how to get people to laugh. Worth the read, if you have nothing better to do :-).

Bottom line taken from [Washington Post](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/aug/17/book-review-not-taco-bell-material/?page=all) - "For anyone hoping for — and, more important, working toward — something better in life, this book could provide some necessary laughs and more than a little encouragement"
