My first post on this blog is dedicated to people who have changed me in the past one year. This post talks about what I have learnt from them and how I see the world differently after "them" happening. Living in another country and immersing yourself to different cultures can be both exciting and challenging. These people have stood by me through some of the most crucial moments of my life. They inspire me to achieve and push the boundaries that exist within me. I've been both fortunate to have worked, shared parts of my life with them. Although I'm geographically disconnected from them by life forces, some parts of them exist in me through the way I look at Life. Here's a brief description of who they are to me and what I learned from them

Meet Mr. Poker Face

I met Mikko during my first few weeks in Zurich. We were in the same german class, we took classes together, partied and hung out a lot. He was very social from the beginning which is quite unusual for finnish people, haha! I learned how stereotyping never works with people. He's perhaps on of my few friends who has unlimited energy supplies, bottled up like cans of redbull. I have sometimes wondered if he will ever give up. When the deadlines for various course projects were cutting us close, he's probably the one cheer leader you would need in your team. When we were about to give up on courses, he'd always be persistent and fight for it. This was explicit when we had hackathons in student rooms of the university lasting 36 hours. I'm sure he'd be up for a club night even after that kind of hackathon, such is the energy he comes with. We had shared some cherishing moments at various occasions during my time in Zurich. Mikko continues to be my close friend and look forward to many more adventures when I return back to Europe.

Meet the Judo Champion!

I met Ilija during some of my classes and probably near a beer machine in student hall. Ilja is fighter both professionally and at studies/research. Some of the things that I was really inspired from Ilija were the head shots he'd perform at the work (whatever he's doing). It may be flirting with a hot serbian girl or research work or partying, he's a perfectionist and classy at that. We were often working, hanging out in ETH, parties and I learned so much from this guy. We used to do night long runs for our exam preps and he was always there to support and work with me. He often likes to sitback at cafe shops, read a book and have nice calm evenings and I can already see how good it is. I learned to look at life in a more organized, relaxed way from him. I happen to share a lot of mutual interest with him in the form of travelling, research and ambitions. I'm waiting for the future to see what it unfolds for us.

Meet the Laidback htownsb!

I met Santosh after arriving in Zurich. We used to hang out a lot after the classes and do the assignments together. Santosh has very clear goals and ambitions, he looks life from a counter-intuitive way. One thing I learned from him was how to loose my anxiety in adverse situations. If you want to chill with him after a day of hard work, he'd be up for it all night long. This guy forms the pillar of my social circle functioning as an instigator, doubter and example. He's most often critic of some of the very basic things you can question about life. I learned to question things happening around me from him. We also share a desi trait of traditions and cultures that haunt us from the past. With him, I look at life in a experiential, affective and in a more aesthetic way. He's currently a PhD student in CMU and I certainly hope to get back with him and chill.  

There are many more people whom I've missed to summarize in this post and who have influenced me. I certainly do thank them for the moments I have shared with and for who I am now. Stay tuned for more updates on my blog!
