It's been a year since I have associated myself with the word "research". I think the time is ripe to take a step back and analyse my life in a holistic perspective towards academic research. In this post I will summarize my previous projects in terms of how I learnt the "process of research" and what problems and opportunities I've identified. Hopefully this will provide insights for my future projects :)

I took a very deep interest in HCI when I was first introduced to it during a seminar by Dr. Sasanka Prabhala (Intel digital experience group) in my sophomore year. He gave an eloquent talk on HCI research methodologies. He talked about how things were different if we can appropriate the semantics behind the design of system to varying user needs. I was more impressed by the human part in the design of systems. The methods that were introduced took a broad perspective in design. To be honest, I felt it was more adventurous and cool to learn and be a part of HCI methodologies like ethnography (I guess I watched a lot of Natgeo lol :-)). I was impressed by the extent to which computer scientist could push the boundaries of science bringing in inter-disciplinary approaches. I felt that in front of HCI methods, traditional computer science methods were very blunt (Beat that! Systems research, optimisations, blah and blah :P). In my junior year I had the opportunity to study in a bigger institution in Switzerland ([ETH ZÃ¼rich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETH_Zurich))

I took this opportunity to venture myself in some good projects. Although the university didn't have a separate research group for HCI research. I was able to accomodate myself into research projects with elements of HCI. It was both self satisfying and rewarding experience to my careeer. My first lesson from this expereince was


> Lesson 1: The university where you do research matters, it doesn't matter if you don't have a seperate research groups on your interested projects


When you do research or projects in top universities, even if they don't have competency in research areas your interested. They would have the resources, ambiance and the environment to support your projects. The key would be to strike a balance with the interested professor/group and your interest.

Project - I 

To begin with I started with a web engineering based group on project involving adapting existing web interfaces for multi-touch interaction. Web engineering inherently has a design component in it, I was lucky and fortunate to find a good advisor PhD student M who would supervise my work. In a move to project my motivation and impress my advisor I came up with a lot of design sketches of interactions to web in a week even before the start of my internship (I know it was a cheesy move, it didn't work - lol, haha). Only in retrospect I'm realizing that how trivial it was to do that without defining the problem definition. My advisor M was kind enough to look through shabby papers consisting of "design sketches" ( Back then I was so disorganized that I produced several papers consisting of haphazardly arranged figures). Inspite of this mayhem he was able to define the problem definition for my project with clear focus. Although it was the beginning stages of my journey with HCI projects, I realised the importance of communicating the ideas through drawing, art and figures especially if it involves some interactions (Interaction design).



> Lesson 2: Problem definition is all the more important than any part of the project/research. It defines your goals, motivations and lays out the path for further focused innovations in the project. 





Unfortunately getting handle on certain problems takes varying amount of time, we'll discuss this in further posts. It is an understatement if I end the post like this, more parts of my lessons coming soon. Stay tuned.
