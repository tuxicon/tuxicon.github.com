                <title>A joke is all about the reference</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Secret ingredient to make people laugh - A funny or retarded expression coupled with a reference people can&#39;t imagine of is all you need. The art of making these jokes are well perfected in this book&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1333128127l/13568887.jpg&quot;&gt;Not a Taco Bell Material&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The books sure not for everybody, but people who like his style of humor are usually people who love to see the funny side of things, even when shit gets bad. Adam corolla is an amazing writer. I have never heard his podcast but he sure does know , how to get people to laugh. Worth the read, if you have nothing better to do :-).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line taken from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/aug/17/book-review-not-taco-bell-material/?page=all&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; - &quot;For anyone hoping for — and, more important, working toward — something better in life, this book could provide some necessary laughs and more than a little encouragement&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>je visite à Pondichéry et j'ai obtenu mon visa</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I have spent close to 3 days in Pondichéry and I have to say that the small but charming city has impressed me. The city is very clean and pristine atleast in the &quot;white town&quot;. The weather is amazing especially near the beach where it is clement. The parts of the city seems to be reminiscent of its strong French ancestry. I was quite surprised by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pondich%C3%A9ry&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; which said there were close to 10000 french people living in Pondichéry. Anyhow, I found Pondichéry to be nice spot for relaxing can be described as serene and calm. Streets and building will remind you of the french architecture and there is a very nice cafe facing the beach with various european coffee options. I missed auroville and french bakeries in the baker street. Hope, I could visit Pondichéry in a relaxed manner rather than visiting it for the purpose of my french visa. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auroville&quot;&gt;Auroville (city of dawn)&lt;/a&gt; is the experimental project started near Pondichéry. Anywho, the news is I have my french visa and I&#39;m  leaving India in 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: I&#39;m letting you in on a secret, french student visa&#39;s are selling like hot pancakes :P. you get them in three days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the photos that I took&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Somewhere along the road of research</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a year since I have associated myself with the word &quot;research&quot;. I think the time is ripe to take a step back and analyse my life in a holistic perspective towards academic research. In this post I will summarize my previous projects in terms of how I learnt the &quot;process of research&quot; and what problems and opportunities I&#39;ve identified. Hopefully this will provide insights for my future projects :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a very deep interest in HCI when I was first introduced to it during a seminar by Dr. Sasanka Prabhala (Intel digital experience group) in my sophomore year. He gave an eloquent talk on HCI research methodologies. He talked about how things were different if we can appropriate the semantics behind the design of system to varying user needs. I was more impressed by the human part in the design of systems. The methods that were introduced took a broad perspective in design. To be honest, I felt it was more adventurous and cool to learn and be a part of HCI methodologies like ethnography (I guess I watched a lot of Natgeo lol :-)). I was impressed by the extent to which computer scientist could push the boundaries of science bringing in inter-disciplinary approaches. I felt that in front of HCI methods, traditional computer science methods were very blunt (Beat that! Systems research, optimisations, blah and blah :P). In my junior year I had the opportunity to study in a bigger institution in Switzerland (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETH_Zurich&quot;&gt;ETH Zürich&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took this opportunity to venture myself in some good projects. Although the university didn&#39;t have a separate research group for HCI research. I was able to accomodate myself into research projects with elements of HCI. It was both self satisfying and rewarding experience to my careeer. My first lesson from this expereince was&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lesson 1: The university where you do research matters, it doesn&#39;t matter if you don&#39;t have a seperate research groups on your interested projects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you do research or projects in top universities, even if they don&#39;t have competency in research areas your interested. They would have the resources, ambiance and the environment to support your projects. The key would be to strike a balance with the interested professor/group and your interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project - I&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with I started with a web engineering based group on project involving adapting existing web interfaces for multi-touch interaction. Web engineering inherently has a design component in it, I was lucky and fortunate to find a good advisor PhD student M who would supervise my work. In a move to project my motivation and impress my advisor I came up with a lot of design sketches of interactions to web in a week even before the start of my internship (I know it was a cheesy move, it didn&#39;t work - lol, haha). Only in retrospect I&#39;m realizing that how trivial it was to do that without defining the problem definition. My advisor M was kind enough to look through shabby papers consisting of &quot;design sketches&quot; ( Back then I was so disorganized that I produced several papers consisting of haphazardly arranged figures). Inspite of this mayhem he was able to define the problem definition for my project with clear focus. Although it was the beginning stages of my journey with HCI projects, I realised the importance of communicating the ideas through drawing, art and figures especially if it involves some interactions (Interaction design).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lesson 2: Problem definition is all the more important than any part of the project/research. It defines your goals, motivations and lays out the path for further focused innovations in the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately getting handle on certain problems takes varying amount of time, we&#39;ll discuss this in further posts. It is an understatement if I end the post like this, more parts of my lessons coming soon. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>We shall change!</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;My first post on this blog is dedicated to people who have changed me in the past one year. This post talks about what I have learnt from them and how I see the world differently after &quot;them&quot; happening. Living in another country and immersing yourself to different cultures can be both exciting and challenging. These people have stood by me through some of the most crucial moments of my life. They inspire me to achieve and push the boundaries that exist within me. I&#39;ve been both fortunate to have worked, shared parts of my life with them. Although I&#39;m geographically disconnected from them by life forces, some parts of them exist in me through the way I look at Life. Here&#39;s a brief description of who they are to me and what I learned from them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet Mr. Poker Face
&lt;a href=&quot;http://saiganesh.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Mikko.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://saiganesh.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Mikko-150x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Words that describe him:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Cheerful, Upbeat, Tenaceous, Persistant, Natural Leader, Party Hard, Strategic thinker, Networker, Finnish&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met Mikko during my first few weeks in Zurich. We were in the same german class, we took classes together, partied and hung out a lot. He was very social from the beginning which is quite unusual for finnish people, haha! I learned how stereotyping never works with people. He&#39;s perhaps on of my few friends who has unlimited energy supplies, bottled up like cans of redbull. I have sometimes wondered if he will ever give up. When the deadlines for various course projects were cutting us close, he&#39;s probably the one cheer leader you would need in your team. When we were about to give up on courses, he&#39;d always be persistent and fight for it. This was explicit when we had hackathons in student rooms of the university lasting 36 hours. I&#39;m sure he&#39;d be up for a club night even after that kind of hackathon, such is the energy he comes with. We had shared some cherishing moments at various occasions during my time in Zurich. Mikko continues to be my close friend and look forward to many more adventures when I return back to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet the Judo Champion!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://saiganesh.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ilija.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://saiganesh.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ilija-150x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Words that describe him:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Willpower, Raw force, Blitzkrieg, Serbian, Passionate, Friendly, Sarcastic, Ambitious&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met Ilija during some of my classes and probably near a beer machine in student hall. Ilja is fighter both professionally and at studies/research. Some of the things that I was really inspired from Ilija were the head shots he&#39;d perform at the work (whatever he&#39;s doing). It may be flirting with a hot serbian girl or research work or partying, he&#39;s a perfectionist and classy at that. We were often working, hanging out in ETH, parties and I learned so much from this guy. We used to do night long runs for our exam preps and he was always there to support and work with me. He often likes to sitback at cafe shops, read a book and have nice calm evenings and I can already see how good it is. I learned to look at life in a more organized, relaxed way from him. I happen to share a lot of mutual interest with him in the form of travelling, research and ambitions. I&#39;m waiting for the future to see what it unfolds for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet the Laidback htownsb!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://saiganesh.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/santosh.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://saiganesh.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/santosh-150x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Words that describe him:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Chill, Relax, Laid back, fellow Desi, Calm, Serene, Openness, Free you minds, Passionate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met Santosh after arriving in Zurich. We used to hang out a lot after the classes and do the assignments together. Santosh has very clear goals and ambitions, he looks life from a counter-intuitive way. One thing I learned from him was how to loose my anxiety in adverse situations. If you want to chill with him after a day of hard work, he&#39;d be up for it all night long. This guy forms the pillar of my social circle functioning as an instigator, doubter and example. He&#39;s most often critic of some of the very basic things you can question about life. I learned to question things happening around me from him. We also share a desi trait of traditions and cultures that haunt us from the past. With him, I look at life in a experiential, affective and in a more aesthetic way. He&#39;s currently a PhD student in CMU and I certainly hope to get back with him and chill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more people whom I&#39;ve missed to summarize in this post and who have influenced me. I certainly do thank them for the moments I have shared with and for who I am now. Stay tuned for more updates on my blog!&lt;/p&gt;
